# Flutter Chat App

A simple Flutter chat app project for ICT4DEV Summer Schools

## Getting Started

This is a basic version of a chat app developed using the Flutter framework

To run the app locally you will need to update ("save") the pubspec.yaml file in the root directory to get all the dependecies needed

TIPS:
Run the app using two or multple devices to simulate a chat scenario

DISCLAIMER: 
It might not work on android devices, try to run it using a web browser in that case. I didn't test it on android. 

Work in progress
